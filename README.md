# Analyzing Crime, Crash Reporting, and Traffic Violations
With a focus on Montgomery County in Maryland, we will be analyzing data about crimes, crashes, and traffic violations to establish if there are any relationships between crimes, crashes, and locations.

# Background
Our project leverages datasets provided by Montgomery Countyâ€™s open data website, dataMontgomery, to provide the public with access to various crime statistic databases, crash data, and traffic violation information.

## Business Problem
The Montgomery County aims to enhance traffic safety by leveraging available data sources, including traffic violations data. Despite having access to valuable datasets such as crime data, crash reporting incidents data, and traffic violations data, the county faces challenges due to the lack of comprehensive data analysis and integration. Without proper analysis and integration, it becomes difficult to gain insights into the frequency and nature of traffic violations occurring within the county.

The primary objective is to develop a data-driven approach to understanding traffic violations and their patterns. This approach involves analyzing traffic violations data to identify trends, hotspots, and contributing factors. By gaining insights into the frequency and distribution of traffic violations, the county can educate itself about prevalent issues and areas of concern.

Key goals include identifying high-traffic violation areas, understanding the factors contributing to violations, and forecasting future trends. Through analysis of historical data, the county can gain a deeper understanding of traffic violation patterns and anticipate future risks. This knowledge can then be used to implement targeted educational initiatives and interventions aimed at promoting traffic safety and reducing violations.

Expected outcomes include improved awareness and understanding of traffic safety issues, enhanced educational programs, and more informed decision-making by stakeholders. By educating itself about traffic violations and their underlying causes, the county can take proactive measures to address safety concerns and promote safer road behavior.

In the long term, implementing a data-driven approach to traffic safety education can lead to a safer and more informed community. It can empower residents, law enforcement agencies, and policymakers with the knowledge and insights needed to create safer roadways and reduce the incidence of traffic violations.

## Project Description
Using open source data sources from Montgomery County, we pulled information from three APIs: crimes, crashes, and traffic violations. Then we transformed the data from the three APIs to perform analysis for our business questions. See DAG below:

# Application Architecture 

## Ingest

**Crime Data**: [link to documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.montgomerycountymd.gov/icn6-v9z3)

This API provides daily postings from Montgomery County's open data website which provides the public with direct access to crime statistic databases. The data provided comes from "EJustice", which is a records-management system used by Montgomery County Police Department.

Limitations of the data: information may not be verified due to investigations, and classifications may be changed in the future.

**Crash Reporting - Incidents Data**: [link to documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.montgomerycountymd.gov/bhju-22kf)

This API provides general information about each collision and details of all traffic collisions occurring on county and local roadways in Montgomery County. Data incorporates information from the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS), as well as information from Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Rockville Police, and the Maryland-National Capital Park Police.

Limitations of the data: information is based on preliminary reporting and may not be verified, data may change at a later date after further investigation.

Updated: Weekly

**Traffic Violations**: [link to documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.montgomerycountymd.gov/4mse-ku6q)

This API contains information about traffic violations from all electronic traffic violations issued within Montgomery County.

Limitations of the data: any information that can be used to uniquely identify the vehicle, vehicle owner, or the office issuing the violation is not published.

Updated: Daily

In Google Cloud Platform, we implemented a data management system by creating separate buckets for each data source: crashes, crime, and traffic violations. These buckets, named "crashesumd," "crime_bucket_api," and "inst767trafficviolationsbucket," respectively, were designed to organize and store the data collected from the corresponding APIs. Moreover, we implemented a scheduler to automate data updates everyday at 9 AM EDT, ensuring that each time the scheduler runs for each API call, the relevant folder within the respective bucket is automatically updated with the latest data.

## Transform

We stored the Spark jobs code in our code storage bucket called `pyspark_bucket_inst767`. Its layout looks like this:

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed specified columns that are not relevant to the analysis, such as computed regions, agency-related information, geolocation data, etc.
  - Cleaned inconsistent values in certain columns by replacing "unknown" values with null and "N/A" values with empty strings.
  - Handled missing values in multiple columns by dropping rows with missing data or filling them with appropriate values.
  - Cleaned latitude and longitude columns by filtering out zero values and nulls.

- **Data Transformation**:
  - Loaded each dataset into a data frame using PySpark code.
  - Applied cleaning functions to handle missing and inconsistent values across all datasets.
  - Removed unnecessary columns to focus on relevant data for analysis.
  - Converted latitude and longitude columns to float type for numerical analysis.

- **Pushing Data to BigQuery**:
  - The cleaned DataFrames were written to BigQuery tables in the `montgomery_datasets` dataset.
  - The write operation for each dataset was performed using the `write` method of the DataFrame, specifying the respective BigQuery table names (`traffic_violations`, `crashes`, `crimes`) and the temporary GCS bucket for data transfer.
  - The mode was set to "overwrite" to replace any existing data in the destination tables. This ensures that the BigQuery tables are updated with the latest cleaned data, maintaining data consistency and accuracy for subsequent analysis. Additionally, duplicate records are automatically removed during the overwrite process, preventing redundant data in the tables.

## Storage
For our storage solution, we opted to utilize BigQuery for its capabilities and compatibility with our project requirements. In addition to storing our data in BigQuery, we structured the storage by creating a database called Montgomery Datasets and in that we created separate tables for each API: crashes, crimes, and traffic violations
