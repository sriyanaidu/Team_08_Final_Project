**Crime Data**:
This API provides daily postings from Montgomery County's open data website which provides the public with direct access to crime statistic databases. The data provided comes from "EJustice", which is a records-management system used by Montgomery County Police Department.

Limitations of the data: information may not be verified due to investigations, classifications may be changed in the future.

**Crash Reporting - Incidents Data**:
This API provides general information about each collision and details of all traffic collisions occuring on county and local roadways in Montgomery County. Data incorporates information from the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS), as well as information from Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Rockville Police, and the Maryland-National Capital Park Police.

Limitations of the data: information is based on preliminary reporting and may not be verified, data may change at a later date after further investigation.

Updated: Weekly

**Traffic Violations**:
This API contains information about traffic violations from all electronic traffic violations issued within Montgomery County.

Limitations of the data: any information that can be used to uniquely identify the vehicle, vehicle owner, or the office issuing the violation is not published.
